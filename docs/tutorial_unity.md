# Toy Unity Tutorial

Let's skip the pleasantries and get straight to business.

In this tutorial, you'll be recreating the [flappybirb example](https://github.com/Ratstail91/flappybirb). You'll need some sprites such as walls, a floor, a ceiling, and of course, your birb. I'm using these:

![birb](img/birb.png)
![block](img/block.png)

I'm using the red block image as a placeholder for everything but the birb.
