# CToy

This is the Toy programming language interpreter, written in C. The current canonical version (written in C#) can be found [here](https://github.com/Ratstail91/Toy).

My goal for writing this language is simply to have fun and to learn, but also to create something that *could* be usable in an actual dev environment.

Special thanks to http://craftinginterpreters.com/ for their fantastic book that I followed to write this.

## Building

To build the project, run `make` in the root directory - this will build the safe option by default.

There is currently no unsafe option available.
