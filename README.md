# Toy

This is the Toy programming language interpreter, written in C.

My goal for writing this language is simply to have fun and to learn, but also to create something that *could* be usable in an actual dev environment, particularly as an extension to a game engine.

The docs can be found under docs/, or you could start [here](docs/toy_reference.md).

Special thanks to http://craftinginterpreters.com/ for their fantastic book that set me on this path.

## Building

To build the project, run `make` in the root directory.
